            Hi <del><i>Reader</i></del> ... <del>You</del> Uhh! Sorry, i'm a bit nerveous. Let's start it again okey? <br>
            Hi, I'm Zoltan. I'm your average 20-30 years old guy. I play video games and i do all sorts of things that i can find <br>
            to pass the time while i'm inside the house. The less i have to move out is the better. In the last couple of years i was
            living in the UK and here i had a chance to meet new people trough work and my hobby, which is great. Year after year i can find
            more and more people who has the same interest as i do which makes finding friends a lot easier. My hobbies requires other peoples,
            since i play tabletop games. In 2020 i did not have as much chance to play with others as i would have loved to, but i opened up
            to alternative ways to keeps in touch with peoples through the internet. I found out that millions of people values my hobbies around
            the world and they play online. This is where i'm playing nowadays. I managed to buy a lot of books as well which i'm reading through
            with lightning speed, which is great. Whoever you are reader, make sure you do the same. It
