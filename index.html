                In my spare time i like to play tabletop games. I tried a lot of them and a couple of years ago i ran into
                roleplaying games...no not that kind. This is a PG website, please...<br>
                I started to play various gaming systems and i ended up playing Dungeons and Dragons. You know, the one the kids played 
                in stranger things. <br>
                I'm going to try and introduce you to some of the basic things so you might have an idea on what i'm doing in my spare time.
                Oh, and with this i can save a lot of wierd conversations with new people who ask me about my hobby. This way they can think
                I'm a nerd without me having to see the wierded out faces :)
