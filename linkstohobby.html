            I'm guessing this is the last page you are visiting. <br> 
            (If not, i would recommend you check the others first. This page will make a lot mor sence that way)<br><br>
            if you are reading this, then you are probably interested at least a little, and it would be rude of me not
            to give you a couple link where you can start developing your interests.

            If you just want to jump in and try out a game, i would suggest you try Monopoly first. It is well known by a lot of people
            and you can find others relatively easy to play with. Press this 
            <a href="https://monopoly.hasbro.com/en-gb"><b>magic button.</b></a>
        </p>

            If you are interested in card games i can't think of any better game to start with then Uno.
            <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/uno/uno"><b>Here</b></a>
            , try it.
        </p>

            Let's say you are interested in roleplaying games. Who could blame you. There are dozens of roleplaying games around to
            choose from. Still, i would suggest you start playing with Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition. It is the easiest to
            get into and that's the most popular for years now.
